# Crime Rate Prediction
## Crime Rate Prediction OverView:
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts crime rates (or types of crimes) in a specific location based on historical data and contextual features such as time, geography, and socio-economic factors.
## Project Objectives:
* Predict the number of crimes in a region (per week/month/year)
* Identify high-risk areas using historical patterns.
* Predict the likelihood or type of crime given a certain location and time.
